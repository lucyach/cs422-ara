## Server Installation

The ARA application uses MongoDB to store and load notes remotely, the app is usable offline but to enable cross-device note syncing a MongoDB cluster is required.

1. Create an account on MongoDB Atlas

2. Create a cluster on MongoDB

3. Create a database user for that cluster

4. Within the network access, either:
    - Whitelist your current IP address
    - Allow access from all locations

5. Acquire and save the connection string from your new cluster

6. Within the app's main menu screen, open the "Server Setup" window. Input the connection string that contains the user credentials to your database.

7. Done, enjoy using the ARA application!


Note: You may have to use `python3` and `pip3` if using the latest Python version.
